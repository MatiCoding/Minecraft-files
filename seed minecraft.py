# This program is made for practising with the random library.
# In this case I want to have a random seed for my new minecraft world and, as I am learning python, I thought it could be a nice thing to try to generate the seed with this language. 

import random # I import the random library.

print(f"Your seed is: {random.randint(1,999999999999999)}")   #We print the seed with the random.randint() function and the seed we get, must be between 1 and 999999999999999
